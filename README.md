## Overview 
The purpose of this project is to utilize Machine Learning to Predict and Visualize Food Insecurity in the United States of America. It will also take an in depth look at physical access to food in the US and its effects on food insecurity.

### Dataset
SQL Team Six originally expressed interest in agricultural data and found a comprehensive data set from the United States Department of Agriculture. It contains country wide information on food insecurity and its related areas on a state and county level. 

The original 2020 Food Environment Atlas dataset can be found at: https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-environment-atlas/data-access-and-documentation-downloads/

 > Direct download link: https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/DataFiles/80526/FoodEnvironmentAtlas.xls?v=2489.7

## Objective
From the above data set the team will look at agriculture, general grocery access, and the restaurant industry as it related to food insecurity. With this data, the group hopes to draw comparisons and craft conclusions about how physical access to food influences food insecurity. A model will also be created that predicts the changes in food insecurity for years not adressed in the origininal data.

### Questions
How does the availability of different food markets impact food insecurity?

#### Potential topics
- Does resturant availability contribute to lowering food insecurity?
- Does havng more farmers markets or more genral grocery stores have a higher positive impact on food access?
- How does agritourism influence food insecurity?
- How do community supported farms verses regular farms have an impact?
