# Final Project: Food Insecurity <dl><sub>by SQL Team 6 </sub></dl>

## Overview 

The purpose of this project is to utilize machine learning to predict and visualize food insecurity in the United States of America (US). It will also take an in-depth look at physical access to food in the US and its effects on food insecurity.

### Background
SQL Team 6 had an initial interest in New York urban agriculture and utilized this idea to begin researching agricultural datasets. Through this research a map was found on the United States Department of Agricultureâ€™s website with many differing data points on food insecurity and related fields involving access, demographics, purchases, locations, etc.

After a reviewing the dataset, the group determined it was large enough, had potential for many interesting comparisons and trends, and had an adequate number of variables to be utilized for the machine learning model and visualization dashboard. After the data was cleaned, the group selected variables with corresponding dates and a possible relation to food insecurity.

Below outlines and explores the various elements of the Food Insecurity Project.

### Datasets

## Supervised Machine Learning Model

Machine learning is the use of statistical algorithms to perform tasks such as learning from data patterns and making predictions. 

A number of feature variables are used on a county level for time periods from 2016 and earlier to predict food insecurity after 2017. Specifically, the goal is to predict the percentage change of food insecurity by state. The group identified the "Balanced Random Forest Classifier" and the "Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier" as our best sampling methods using confusion matrices and accuracy scores. 

Two key issues with the model are balancing the heavily skewed dataset and making state level predictions using county level features.

### Description of Data
Our original data source is a comprehensive resource to analyze food insecurity and possible relating variables by locations including Federal Information Processing System (FIPS) Codes, counties, and states. The variables that accompany the food insecurity data include how and where consumers access food and how numerous these access points are within a given location. In addition to the original dataset, the group has acquired additional food insecurity data to help expand our analysis and predictions.

The tables below include the Stores Table, Local Table, Restaurants Table, and Insecurity Table. 

#### Tables 

<Details><Summary>Stores Table</Summary>
The Stores Table shows the percent change of grocery stores from 2011 to 2016 by FIPS, state and county.

## Objective
Using this dataset the team will analyze how access to agriculture, groceries, and restaurants effects food insecurity. The group hopes to draw comparisons and craft conclusions about how physical access to food effects food insecurity. A model will also be created that predicts possible changes in food insecurity based on the original data.

### Questions
How does physical access to food through restaurants and grocery stores impact food insecurity?

#### Potential topics
- How are fast food expenditures related to food insecurity?
- Does restaurant availability contribute to lowering food insecurity?
- Which has a greater positive impact on food access, having more farmers markets or more general grocery stores?
- How does agritourism influence food insecurity?
- Do community supported farms and regular farms have differing impacts on food insecurity?

## Descriptive Analysis and Data Visualization
To explore the data travel to the [dashboard link.](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/emery.scott/viz/FoodInsecurityDashboard/HousholdFoodInsecurityasitRelatestoPhysicalAccess?publish=yes)

Below the group shares images from the interactive dashboard and some subsequent observations.

### Percent Change in Food Insecurity Over Time
From 2008 to 2017 food insecurity decreased in all fifty states except for North Dakota, Louisiana, and West Virginia. However, North Dakota has one of the lowest  food insecurity pecentages in the country, while Mississippi has some of the highest annual food insecurity percentages in the country.

Between 2008 and 2010, the states with the lowest food insecurity percentage were North Dakota, Virginia, New Hampshire, Delaware, and Minnesota. From 2017 to 2019 the states with the lowest food insecurity percentage were Iowa, New Hampshire, and New Jersey, followed by North Dakota and Minnestota with an equal food insecurity percentage. 

Between 2008 and 2010 Mississippi, Texas, Arkansas, Alabama, and Georgia had the highest levels of food insecurity. The previously mentioned states all reduced food insecurity from 2017 to 2019, leaving Mississippi, Louisiana, West Virginia, and New Mexico as the most food insecure states for the time period.

#### Pefcent Change in Local Agritourism Operations by State

The image below shows the change in agritourism operations versus the change in CSA farms, direct farm sales per capita, and farms with direct sales. Overall, convenience stores recorded increasing locations in a significant number of states, while grocery stores recorded diminishing numbers from 2011-2016.
