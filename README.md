   To predict impact of Food Insecurity 
                                       _on Health Standards?
                                       _on Fast-food?
                                       _on Agro_Tourism
                                       _on CSA Farms 
                                       

# Homework_2 : Identify Hypothesis & Data Set

  - What constitutes an urban farm? 
  - Indoor vs Outdoor
  - Urban vs Rural Definition 
  - Types of Farming: Monocrop , Largescale, Verticle farming, Hydro

7. Need a Dataset, What are the best candidates?

# Homework_1 : Identify Hypothesis & Data Set 

## Michael C:

    Specific Topic : Indoor Agriculture, also known as Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA), is a rapidly growing industry driven by the increasing  demand for locally grown produce. How has CEA production changed over the past decade in Urban areas ? What are the costs/benefits of CEA compared to traditional agriculture. 
    
    Hypothesis_1   : The growth of indoor agriculture, CEA, has grown over the past 10 years due to technological increases in efficiency. What is the Yield of CEA productions compared to traditional agriculture? 
    
    
    Hypothesis_2   :
    
    
    Data Set       : This is the best Paper and Data Sources regarding CEA for Machine Learning.

## Emery S:
    
    What is the efficacy of urban agriculture relative to non-urban agricultural production?
      - Power cunsumption
      - cost efficiency
      - neccessity of urban agriculture
      - Growth of plants in a controlled environment

    Can we predict crop yield for the coming year based on past data?
      - Trends in soil changes
      - Weather trends influence
      - supply and demand based on yield
      - perhaps we select a specific loaction for crop yields or we select a specific crop and cover its growth over many locations.
