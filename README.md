### Objective:
    Project to Food Insecurity using USDA Dataset. 
    We pick a variable and create a narrow question / hypothesis. 
    
### Hypothesis:

   To predict impact of Food Insecurity 
                                       _on Health Standards?
                                       _on Fast-food?
                                       _on Agro_Tourism
                                       _on CSA Farms 
                                       
## Farmers market access vrs food insecurity?

### 1. Do areas with more access impact on or correlate with food security or insecurity? -How does the availability of food markets impact on food insecurity

### 2 Is there an increase or decrease in food security/insecurity? Can we then determine by State or County a trend or relationship?                                       
                                       

# Homework_2 : Identify Hypothesis & Data Set 

 Every has : Supplemental County, Supplemental State, and INSECURITY
 
 TO DO     : 
 
 1. Refine the assigned datasets. 
 2. Change column names , to names listed in Variables
 3. Come up at least 2 questions from cleaning the dataset. Make an informed hypothesis.

    ## Questions
    
## Farmers market access vrs food insecurity?
## 1. Do areas with more access impact on or correlate with food security or insecurity? 
-How does the availability of food markets impact on food insecurity 
## 3. Is there an increase or decrease in food security/insecurity? Can we then determine by State or County a trend or relationship?

## Vasiliy: 
    
    ### Questions:
        Food insecurity increase vs Fast Food Restaurants growth or full service restaurants decline
        Food insecurity vs superstore locations vs Walmart?

## Brenton:
    - Stores
    - Local 
    
### Does an increase in farmers' market access reduce food insecurity?
### Do areas with agrotourism/increased agrotourism have lower levels of food insecurity?

### Key Todo's

1. 



## Meeting_1 Notes

1. Review Class Project GitHub Push 

3. Come up with 2-3 Questions or Datasets to Focus on. Next meeting decide direction. 

5. What is our Goal ? 
  -  Urban Agricultural Growth - Micro Story 
  -  Global Agriculture Growth - Macro Story 

6. Challenges : 
  - What constitutes an urban farm? 
  - Indoor vs Outdoor
  - Urban vs Rural Definition 
  - Types of Farming: Monocrop , Largescale, Verticle farming, Hydro

7. Need a Dataset, What are the best candidates? 
      [1] USDA Data set 
      [2] 
 

# Homework_1 : Identify Hypothesis & Data Set 

## Michael C:

    Specific Topic : Indoor Agriculture, also known as Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA), is a rapidly growing industry driven by the increasing  demand for locally grown produce. How has CEA production changed over the past decade in Urban areas ? What are the costs/benefits of CEA compared to traditional agriculture. 
    
    Hypothesis_1   : The growth of indoor agriculture, CEA, has grown over the past 10 years due to technological increases in efficiency. What is the Yield of CEA productions compared to traditional agriculture? 
    
    
    Hypothesis_2   :
    
    
    Data Set       : This is the best Paper and Data Sources regarding CEA for Machine Learning.

## Emery S:
    
    What is the efficacy of urban agriculture relative to non-urban agricultural production?
      - Power cunsumption
      - cost efficiency
      - neccessity of urban agriculture
      - Growth of plants in a controlled environment

    Can we predict crop yield for the coming year based on past data?
      - Trends in soil changes
      - Weather trends influence
      - supply and demand based on yield
      - perhaps we select a specific loaction for crop yields or we select a specific crop and cover its growth over many locations.

# Meeting 2 Notes
1. Question
Based on the Datasets we have pulled and the data we have available, ACCESS and specifically PHYSICAL ACCESS.

## Question
Farmers market access vrs food insecurity?
1. Do areas with more access impact on or correlate with food security or insecurity? 
-How does the availability of food markets impact on food insecurity 
3. Is there an increase or decrease in food security/insecurity? Can we then determine by State or County a trend or relationship?
