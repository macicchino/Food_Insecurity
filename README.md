Our team had originally expressed interest in working with agricultural data. In the process of looking for a suitable dataset, we found meaningful data that has the ability to show food insecurityâ€™s relationships with agriculture, grocers, and the restaurant industry.

## Dataset

SQL Team Six has decided to use a comprehensive data set from the United States Department of Agriculture. The dataset we have chosen powers the USDA's Food Environment Atlas. The Food Environment Atlas dataset contains a plethora of data from county and state levels that focus on health, food access, socioeconomics, nutrition assistance programs, and agricultural acreage. 

The original 2020 Food Environment Atlas dataset can be found at: https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-environment-atlas/data-access-and-documentation-downloads/

## Question:

How does the availability of different food markets impact food insecurity?

Areas of interest include CSA farms, farmers' markets, types of grocers, restaurant availability, and agritourism.
