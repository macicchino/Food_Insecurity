# Overview: NYC_Urban_Agriculture

### Admin: 
    Extra Meeting on Wednesday, March 8th. 
    TIME TBD

### Objective:
    Project to review trends and analysis of Urban Agriculture. 

### Hypothesis:

   **TBD**

    1. 3/2/23 Team Meeting to Identify Hypothesis
    2. 3/2/23 Team Meeting to Identify Data Set to Test Hypothesis



## Meeting_1 Notes

1. Review Class Project GitHub Push 

3. Come up with 2-3 Questions or Datasets to Focus on. Next meeting decide direction. 

5. What is our Goal ? 
  -  Urban Agricultural Growth - Micro Story 
  -  Global Agriculture Growth - Macro Story 

6. Challenges : 
  - What constitutes an urban farm? 
  - Indoor vs Outdoor
  - Urban vs Rural Definition 
  - Types of Farming: Monocrop , Largescale, Verticle farming, Hydro

7. Need a Dataset, What are the best candidates? 
      [1] USDA Data set 
      [2] 
 

# Homework_1 : Identify Hypothesis & Data Set 

## Michael C:

    Specific Topic : Indoor Agriculture, also known as Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA), is a rapidly growing industry driven by the increasing  demand for locally grown produce. How has CEA production changed over the past decade in Urban areas ? What are the costs/benefits of CEA compared to traditional agriculture. 
    
    Hypothesis_1   : The growth of indoor agriculture, CEA, has grown over the past 10 years due to technological increases in efficiency. What is the Yield of CEA productions compared to traditional agriculture? 
    
    
    Hypothesis_2   :
    
    
    Data Set       : 



## Emery S:
    
    What is the efficacy of urban agriculture relative to non-urban agricultural production?
      - Power cunsumption
      - cost efficiency
      - neccessity of urban agriculture
      - Growth of plants in a controlled environment

    Can we predict crop yield for the coming year based on past data?
      - Trends in soil changes
      - Weather trends influence
      - supply and demand based on yield
      - perhaps we select a specific loaction for crop yields or we select a specific crop and cover its growth over many locations.
